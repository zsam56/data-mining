These are a couple of homeworks from my Data Mining class.

The Decision Tree homework consists of a classifier file and a trainer file. The classifier, when ran on a data set, will create the trainer file which consists of the tree itself. The classifier creates splits based on the lowest entropy of any given attribute threshold.

The KMeans homework is just a simple implementation of the KMeans algorithm run on a dataset.

The Vehicle Speeds folder consists of two homeworks. One is an implementation of Otsu's method and the other consists of an algorithm to find a threshold that produces the lowest missclassification rate with regards to a list of car speeds.
